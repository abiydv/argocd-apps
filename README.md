# Grafana Dashboards with ArgoCD

Example configs to deploy grafana dashboards with argocd.

This workaround uses `kustomize` to modify the manifests generated by the [grafana helm chart](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/grafana).  

Please ensure the property `kustomize.buildOptions: --enable-helm` is set in argocd configs before using this.
